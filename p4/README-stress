To do:
- create a testing directory 
- cp ~cs537-3/test/p4/stress-test/* <your test directory>
- cd <your test directory>
- the Makefile assumes that your files are called:
spin.c spin.h
counter.c counter.h
list.c list.h
hash.c hash.h

If your files are not called so, you need to either change the names or change
the Makefile.

Copy above files to your test directory.

- make
- ./testCounter (this test your counter library)
- ./testList
- ./testHash

Note: 
1. don't forget to type setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .
2. testcount.c stress test your libcounter.so
if your lib is thread-safe, you should get a "congrats" message
if not, you will get an "argghh" message

similarly, testhash.c stress test your libhash.so; testlist.c stress test your
liblist.so

3. remember to run on machine that has more than one processor
e.g., use mumble-??.cs.wisc.edu
or best-mumble.cs.wisc.edu
